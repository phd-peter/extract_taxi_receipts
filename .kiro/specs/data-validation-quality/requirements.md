# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds basic data validation to the taxi receipt extraction system. The system will validate three key aspects: team member name verification against a predefined list, date validation to ensure receipts are from 2025 or later, and fare amount validation to flag unusually high amounts over 100,000 KRW.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want the system to verify extracted names against our predefined team member list, so that receipts are properly attributed to known employees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system extracts a name from a receipt THEN it SHALL check if the name matches any predefined team member
2. WHEN the extracted name matches a predefined team member THEN the system SHALL use the correct team member name
3. WHEN the extracted name does not match any predefined team member THEN the system SHALL keep the extracted name as-is

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user processing taxi receipts, I want the system to validate that receipt dates are from 2025 or later, so that I can identify potentially incorrect dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system extracts a date from a receipt THEN it SHALL check if the year is 2025 or later
2. WHEN the date is before 2025 THEN the system SHALL log a warning message
3. WHEN the date is 2025 or later THEN the system SHALL process normally without warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an accounting user, I want the system to flag high fare amounts over 100,000 KRW, so that I can review potentially unusual charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system extracts a fare amount THEN it SHALL check if the amount exceeds 100,000 KRW
2. WHEN the fare amount is over 100,000 KRW THEN the system SHALL log a warning message
3. WHEN the fare amount is 100,000 KRW or less THEN the system SHALL process normally without warnings
